## Introduction
SteamShowCase is a software that allows you to convert videos into GIFs and segment them into five parts, to beautify your Steam profile via the Workshop showcase.
This tool also aims to save you money because it's a free alternative to services like DeviantArt, which charge between â‚¬3 and â‚¬10 for this sort of thing ðŸ˜‚.

<h2>For best results, use 720p videos.</h2>

ðŸ’« Which gave me the idea to code : https://www.deviantart.com/tag/steamworkshop

Find video game or anime edits on YouTube easily with the following searches:
- For anime: "this is 4k anime [character name]"
- For games: "[Game name] [Character name] edit"
- For series: "[Series name] [Character name] edit"


## How it Works
SteamShowCase takes a video, converts it into a GIF, segments the GIF into five equal parts, and optimizes each to adhere to Steam's 5MB file size limit. It fine-tunes the GIFs by adjusting frame rates and optionally reducing quality, along with modifying the hex code to remove borders, ensuring a seamless display on your Steam profile.

  - FPS adjustment: Customize the frame rate according to your preference.
  - Quality control: Choose to maintain quality or reduce file size with an optional quality reduction.
  - Hex modification: The tool automatically adjusts the hex code of the GIFs to ensure compatibility with Steam's interface.
